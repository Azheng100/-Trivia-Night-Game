## Description: 
The anime genre for television shows and movies has become a hot commodity in western nations. I believe that capitalizing on this trend will will be a fruitful endeavor. This will be a Javascript trivia game based on anime character quotes. It will be a simple game where the person selects the correct anime character that spoke the randomly generated quote. The game will use the call api function to generate answer choices and will also make use of arrays and objects to create dummy choices. The player will answer ten questions correctly in order to win. They will have 3 health points and will lose the game once it reaches 0 before they get 10 correct answers. 


### How to get started: 
First I set up a trello board to plan out the week. I took the api from github directory and imported it into my javascript file. Next was to create the boilerplates for a simple template. I created a wireframe before generating the grid in html. Once the grid is complete, I will have to work on the javascript and then use css to make the game presentable.
