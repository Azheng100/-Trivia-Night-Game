#H1 -Anime Trivia-Night-Game

#H2 Description: 
This will be a trivia game based on anime show facts. It will be a simple game where the person selects the correct answer from four choices that will answer the prompted question. Stretch goals would be to impletement a timer and a health bar. The timer would be a challenge to see if the player can complete the game within the allocated time by answering a certain amount of questions. The health bar would be implemented to dissuade the player from just guessing wildly. 


#H3 How to get started: 
Take the api from github and import it into my javascript file. Create the boilerplate files. Create a wireframe before creating the grid in html. Once the grid is complete, I will have to work on the javascript and then use css to make the game presentable.
